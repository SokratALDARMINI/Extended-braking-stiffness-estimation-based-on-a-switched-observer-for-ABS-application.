# Extended-braking-stiffness-estimation-based-on-a-switched-observer-for-ABS-application.
Mainly we analyis the switched observer design in the work [1], which considers the design of an observer for the extended braking stiffness (XBS). In the context of hybrid anti-lock brake systems (ABS). In [1], they consider also the design of a closed-loop wheel-acceleration controller based on the observation of the extended braking stiffness. However, we focus only on the the observer design, which is based on Burckhardt’s tire model. It worth mentioning that the XBS is one of the state variables of Burckhardt’s tire model.

In the project, one can follow a live script to develop his knowledge in the field of switched systems.
